# HM2
Originally a school C++ project which I wanted to modify. The assignment PDF explains the prompt and task of the program.

The original HM2 file was the project I submitted back when my knowledge in programming was still limited, for example, we were not allowed to use functions or multiple files for the project, I planned on changing that.
There is also no error handling in the original program. 

The original file should run (with a good chance of errors). 

I have since improved on it, I rewrote the program into two files, a source file and a main file.

The new implementation uses functions to do all the different number system conversions.

It supports more conversions than the original assignment asked for.

It also has a simple form of exception handling. Perhaps I can also improve on that at a later time. 

Exception handling for this program can be extended into the fact that the user can input an invalid number for the specific base system,
for example, 102 would be an invalid binary number. This program does not check for that yet. Perhaps an update to this program would validate this.
