# HM2
A school C++ project which I want to modify.
The assignment PDF explains the prompt and task of the program.
The original HM2 file was the project I submitted back when my knowledge in programming was still limited,
for example, we were not allowed to use functions or multiple files for the project, I plan on changing that.
There is also no error handling in the original program. 
The rest of the files are a work in progress, but the original file should run (with a good chance of errors). 

I have since improved on it, I rewrote the program into two files, a source file and a main file.
The new implementation uses functions to do all the different number system conversions.
It supports more conversions than the original assignment asked for.
It also has a basic form of exception handling. Perhaps I can also improve on that at a later time. 
The original code had 500 lines (very long, innefficient, and redundant), the improved version is around 200 lines in total.
