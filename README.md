# HM2
A school C++ project which I want to modify
The assignment PDF explains the prompt and task of the program
The original HM2 file was the project I submitted back when my knowledge in programming was still limited,
for example, we were not allowed to use functions or multiple files for the project, I plan on changing that.
There is also no error handling in the original program. 
The rest of the files are a work in progress, but the original file should run.
